DengAI challenge code and submission


This is my submission for DengAI challenge.

The ipython notebook has EDA as well as a regression model used for computing the values.
All the methodologies and ways are explained in the notebook.

Other models were also used during my analysis however as the submission required one final model, the best performing one has been presented in the notebook.

The submission file contains the output format of the submission clearly made.
